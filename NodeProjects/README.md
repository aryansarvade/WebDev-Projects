Download the files and folders as they are in your project(working) directory. Then run 'npm i' to install all dependencies.
Then run 'node index.js' to run the server. The default port i used is 3000, but you may change it as per your need.
The projects are just a skeleton version of larger and more beautiful projects. the intention was to practice and keep the 
code very simple to understand.
